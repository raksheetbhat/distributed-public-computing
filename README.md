Distributed Public Computing and Storage using Mobile Devices

The increasing number and power of mobile devices makes them an attractive target for public resource computing. With a vast number of 
such devices, an effective volunteer computing solution can be realized, utilizing their idle CPU cycles and
free storage space. We have created a distributed computing platform for mobile devices, where the user uploads his dataset, 
the Java compute code, which runs on the data parallely, and the merge code that will be run on the server after completion.

The platform also provides decentralized public storage using an user-allotted memory size for which threshold cryptography is used 
to reduce redundancy and account for the unreliability of mobile devices. The freedom of uploading projects and ease
of accessing the system is much better in our system than in existing systems.
